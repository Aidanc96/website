## Line 63 in contact.html, a google maps javascript api key is needed.

## GitHub doesnt want to show slideshow image text but it is displaying when viewing the file itself.


During the development process my original design was very basic and boring and after finding out that 
i could make a more advanced website without using bootstrap for example. i decided to scrap the origninal idea 
and go for a new approach

## I have included the files and put then into the wbeistes directory because the readme link works inconsistantly.

Here are images of my designing for the website along with the site map. the idea i was going for, was a interactive but clean looking site.
so that is it easy to navigate and being able to clearly view the site. The development process as a whole when very well dispite having a
couple of issues where i would have forgot to capitilise a letter for curtain JavaScript variables making then hard to problem solve later on.
